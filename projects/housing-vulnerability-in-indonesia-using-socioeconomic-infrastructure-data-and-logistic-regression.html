      Housing Vulnerability in Indonesia Using Socioeconomic Infrastructure Data and Logistic Regression
    </h1>

    <p class="text-gray-600">
      This project applies <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> to classify housing
      vulnerability across Indonesian provinces using
      <strong>socioeconomic and infrastructure indicators</strong>
      published by <strong>Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)</strong>.

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Problem & Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Housing quality is a critical indicator of social welfare and development.
      Identifying provinces with relatively vulnerable housing conditions is essential
      for supporting evidence-based policy analysis, regional development planning,
      and targeted infrastructure intervention.

  <!-- EDA -->
  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to examine the distribution
      and variability of socioeconomic and infrastructure indicators across provinces
      prior to model training.
    </p>

      alt="Feature Distribution of Housing Indicators"
      class="block mx-auto max-w-full md:max-w-3xl rounded-xl shadow-md">

    <p class="text-gray-700">
      The distribution plots indicate that most provinces exhibit high access to
      basic infrastructure such as clean water, electricity, and non-earth flooring,
      with values concentrated near the upper range.
      In contrast, expenditure per capita shows a wider spread, highlighting
      significant socioeconomic disparities across Indonesian provinces.
      This contrast motivates the inclusion of both infrastructure and economic
      indicators in the classification model.

  <!-- MODEL INTERPRETATION -->
  <section class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Model Interpretation</h2>

    <p>
      To ensure transparency and interpretability, Logistic Regression coefficients
      were analyzed to understand how each indicator contributes to housing vulnerability.
    </p>

    <img
      src="../assets/img/project/housing_vulnerability/02_logistic_regression_coefficients.png"
      alt="Logistic Regression Coefficients"
      class="block mx-auto max-w-full md:max-w-3xl rounded-xl shadow-md">

    <p class="text-gray-700">
      The coefficient plot shows that clean water access, electricity access,
      and non-earth floor percentages have negative coefficients,
      indicating that better infrastructure conditions reduce the likelihood
      of housing vulnerability.
      Meanwhile, expenditure per capita has a positive coefficient,
      reflecting its strong role in differentiating provinces under the
      benchmark-based labeling approach.
      Overall, the model highlights infrastructure access as a key protective factor.

      alt="Confusion Matrix"
      class="block mx-auto max-w-full md:max-w-3xl rounded-xl shadow-md">

    <p class="text-gray-700">
      The confusion matrix indicates perfect classification performance on the test set,
      with no false positives or false negatives.
      All provinces labeled as vulnerable and non-vulnerable were correctly classified.
      However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number
      of provinces used for evaluation, which may lead to optimistic performance estimates.

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Key Insights</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Access to basic infrastructure significantly reduces housing vulnerability.</li>
      <li>Socioeconomic capacity remains an important differentiating factor.</li>
      <li>Logistic Regression provides interpretable and policy-relevant insights.</li>

  <!-- LIMITATIONS -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Limitations & Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      This study relies on aggregated provincial-level data and a limited sample size.
      Future work may incorporate time-series analysis, additional housing indicators,
      or finer spatial resolution to improve generalizability.
